# AutoTag #

The AutoTag plugin enables teachers to get a list of suggested tags for resources. The corresponding files are passed through an LLM such as GPT to identify possible tags. This helps teachers to tag resources more quickly, which can be beneficial for them as well as their students (e.g., for using the official Tags block).

An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com) is required to use this plugin. Site administrators can set the key in the settings page of the plugin.

## Installing via uploaded ZIP file ##
